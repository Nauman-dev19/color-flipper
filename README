# Color Flipper Project

## Overview

The Color Flipper project is a simple JavaScript-based application that dynamically changes the background color of a webpage and automatically adjusts the text color to ensure proper contrast and readability.

This project demonstrates practical usage of JavaScript fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, event handling, random number generation, and conditional logic.

## Features

- Generates a random hexadecimal background color
- Displays the generated color code on the screen
- Automatically switches text color (light or dark) based on background brightness
- Ensures better readability using brightness calculation logic

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)

---

## How It Works

1. A button click triggers the color generator.
2. Random RGB values are generated and converted into a HEX color.
3. The background color of the page is updated.
4. Brightness is calculated using the luminance formula.
5. Text color changes automatically based on brightness value.

## Formula Used for Brightness

(r × 299 + g × 587 + b × 114) / 1000

---

## Usage

- Click the button to generate a new background color.
- The displayed hex code reflects the current background color.
- Text color adjusts automatically for optimal contrast.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding RGB and HEX color formats
- Applying conditional rendering using ternary operators
- Writing clean and reusable JavaScript functions
- Improving accessibility through contrast handling
